graphfloat.ino(in 2025 folder) and rov float-for computer.py(in 2023 folder) are the correct ones
1.  ensure wifi and bluetooth are on
2. turn on float; confirm esp32 is on by checking the red light
3. test buoyancy engine by pulling and pushing at least once before putting into water
4. after putting the float into water, check whether the time is ticking/bluetooth is connected
5. if not, either get closer to the float or pull it up slightly to get a better connection
6. click dive and wait around two minutes for the entire cycle to finish
7. after two minutes the data should show up on the google sheets (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1l9fQ2_P42tdo-NMY-iV2iqaUs8bRqyZpD1TH2Bab2fw/)
